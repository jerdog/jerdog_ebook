Challenging Biased Thoughts begins with: - Identify negatively biased thoughts - Identify any thinking traps - Challenge the biased thought - Develop a rational response (change the thought) - Carol at #Monktoberfest

Code Review Anxiety is ‚Äúfear of judgement, criticism, and negative evaluation while giving or receiving code reviews‚Äù. It‚Äôs very common. But we‚Äôre not alone, and it can be a blocker. Avoiding is a short-term response, with long-term consequences. - Carol at #Monktoberfest

His first day at Pivotal, he didn‚Äôt know anyone, and immediately was met by someone who became his impromptu tour guide and showed them care and attention. Later he found out that person was a VP. - Eamon at #Monktoberfest
He spent time at Pivotal &amp; touches on the pairing culture there in the engineering department and influenced the way Pivotal was.. and their emphasis on: - Do the right thing. - Do what works. - Be kind. And he loved how the people took it to heart. - Eamon at #Monktoberfest

Hell... just marketing in and of itself. Like who _hasn't_ consumed some thing because of what they heard/saw/read about it? There's a _reason_ that there are companies on Instagram and you can buy shit straight from the feed based on what you've liked.
10x marketing
You just literally said "companies want your credibility, not your celebrity" - that's saying it's one thing and that companies _only_ hire for credibility. I know for a FACT that many companies hire individuals _because_ of what they can bring to the bottom line, not credibility
So sorry you feel this way. You are welcome and a valuable member.
We gatekeep when we say "DevRel is only about one thing and if you're about the other thing you're not doing your job well"
And any time we try to convince ourselves that we weren't hired based on what we can bring to the company (i.e. HELP THEM MAKE MONEY!) we lose a bit of ourselves.
Also - "personal brand" has _always_ been a discussion around DevRel in community and devrel podcasts. It's a part of it. Is it all of it? No. But it is a part of it.
A person's brand _can_ be the value they bring to a community. Are you saying that anyone who's worked in devrel/community isn't hired because of our experience doing that thing? Especially if that company wants to make inroads to a specific community? We've all benefited.

In all your grifting, I guess you missed this... Barr and the DOJ already did....
No honest person can look at the lies being spouted by your client and continue to speak them. Since you wave your "Christianity" around, let this sink in: Exodus 23:1 - ‚ÄúYou shall not spread a false report. You shall not join hands with a wicked man to be a malicious witness."
Yep. They've cast doubt so much doubt on the whole process, that when Trump's own appointed cronies don't back him &amp; instead speak the truth, the only next step for them is to decry them as "the Deep State" &amp; they must also be in on it. He's eroding democracy more now than ever.
Ahh the grift continues. As a lawyer, albeit a former traffic lawyer before Trump tapped her blondeness, she knows what "burden of proof" is. It is so sad to see friends and family members get caught up further in Trump's lies and grift, all to pay off his debts ($450m raised).
I'm sure in traffic court they utilise a concept called "burden of proof". In layman's terms, it's where the accuser (i.e. you and Trump) must show proof of allegations of a crime in a court of Law. That might help you out since it seems you have yet to do so in court. Tick tock.

Today's Image of the Day: SpaceX Crew Dragon Approaches Space Station -
Thank you to everyone who participated in #devopspartygames last night, and who contributed to the EFF. Here's a screenshot of my contribution.
Don't forget the big orchestra build up
So that link only works while the game is happening &amp; during the livestream the chat has the code for those watching the stream. We try to call it out for those that may be watching but not looking at the chat, but we don't always do that.
Ah yes, I've not been happy with restream
Lol yeah from what I can tell there was a lot of traffic that they didn't scale well with that night
‰πÅ( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢ )„Ñè
That's where I'm thinking if we have some highlight reels which include the chat and such, and as hosts/mods we can interact with the chat a bit more, that could be cool
Yeah this is what I do with Streamyard and it's pretty cool to pop up comments on the screen... Having a mod for just this could be super helpful
Oh that's an interesting idea!
I'm also wondering if we can separately record the live chat and then overlay that on the recording so it accomplishes the same thing in some way?
I'm not sure if Twitch can do this, but there are some streaming platforms which allow you to select a comment and have it pop up on the screen, which helps some aspects of the live chat live on after the stream is done.

I was a Snagit pro... Like I said, lost art.
Snagit
Videos should not exist without text; text should not exist without video/visuals. In all things... be excellent.
See, I used to write printable docs for software _years_ ago, and a good screenshot can go a long ways! The art of taking them, and putting them into content in the correct spot, is a lost art I think. It's why I look to companion vids to fill that hole at times.
Yeah, I tend to fall into that camp as well - but I do find myself wishing there was a companion video for the blog post to help me visualise what I'm currently trying to learn via text, to make sure I've gotten when they got.
Oh I agree... For me, solid content for devs is a mix of video (short- and long-form), tutorials, blog posts, talks, etc. Every developer is different, and learns differently, and you should never paint yourself into a corner with content.
LOL "written words" is an entirely different thing from this
Yeah for sure... Confidence that they know what they're talking about, and if problems arise during the stream you know they'll be able to fix it.

Mandatory voting is dramatically different from "if everyone voted"
Multiple replies crisscrossing
But here's the thing. If _everyone_ voted, America would look different than it does today. Politicians would be held accountable and would have to listen to their constituents. But people decide not to use their vote for whatever reason. ¬Ø\_‡≤†_‡≤†_/¬Ø And so it goes.
You're right. It's your right not to vote. But don't confuse "not voting" with "voting".
Voting is a verb. You can't vote by not voting. That's like drinking by not drinking. You can't do something by not doing that thing. You can make the choice not to vote. That's fine. That's your prerogative. But that's not voting.
People need to vote.

I'm finally asleep - and a creepy dog is talking to me and playing the guitar. Seems right. Must be the commune's bard. Now he's telling me I need to make friends. So, if you know me, let's be friends in the virtual virtual world.
Oh good - it's my tent. Fantastic. And he's left me some "gifts" to use. This is tiring.
Tom's suggesting I should go sleep in his tent and gives me my own camping cot... Let me guess - it sleeps 2. And he's waiting for me to invite him to cuddle.
And now Buck is telling me that sitting around a campfire with pear juice means we're family and I can call him "Bro"... I'm anticipating I'm going to have to battle him back at night when he gets scared in his tent. This tracks.
Oh great... we're all doing a toast with this pear "juice" and I get the credit. Yay.
Ooooh... I got a fancy title "Resident Representative of Tom Sux" I feel like I've regressed
Oh look at that... Tom's "letting" us pick the name of the island that "we" built. He really is a benevolent asshat, isn't he? I did in fact write "Tom Sux" but it wouldn't let me finish the rest... And just like that, he's "relying" on me to make the critical decisions. Yep.
it's fine... I'll get over it. It's good we're all learning.
These festivities blow... And Tom tells "us" that "he" has built such a great community (you can't have a community without "commun[e]" I guess) from scratch... and it'll test his business acumen... Sounds like some project meetings I've been to...
you mean I was supposed to immediately stop reading what the rest of the wall of text said? Just because you had "(spoiler alert)" there? At least next time add a CRLF so I know to stop speed reading... sheesh ü§£üòÇ
Well, whaddya know... Project Manager Tom _CAN_ do actual work... he rubbed some sticks together (at least I think he did - his back was to us so for all I know he dropped lighter fluid on them and lit them) and "the festivities have begun"... I'm waiting for the festivities...
I most definitely _did_ pick more pears than I needed for Tom's commune potluck, and made sure to take all extra tree branches and pears from outside Dierdre's tent. Not like she's doing any work.
Oh.... I just noticed I can type words at Tom. I have definitely told him how I feel about him.
And as mentioned... I am now collecting the fruit, which project manager Tom has identified as pears... after eating them... and not collecting them... couldn't be assed evidently.
Now I have am COLLECTING THE FRACKING PEARS? SIX OF THEM??? This fat ass trash panda couldn't have grabbed them when he WAS TASTING THEM TO FIND OUT THEY WERE IN FACT PEARS? Definitely a project manager.
Wait... Project Manager Tom (who's made me do all the work so far) just said _he'll_ be sharing the island with me as well? Why do I feel like I stumbled into a game preparing me for joining a commune?
Yeah... picking the branches? WTF? He seems like a normal project manager - making everyone else do the work.
And then I have to do the work for them in picking their spot? They're going to be high maintenance aren't they....
After picking the island - I have to share it with Dierdre and Buck? Not a fan of sharing an island in a game
Oh... fancy!
Now I'm creating a "portrait" of myself... And then choosing a home... Any pointers here?
I'm `jerdog`....
You are not my "partners"... And the "long haul?" Not sure I like where this is heading
I'm already a bit pissed at "Timmy" and "Tommy"... WTF? You're flying to the island with me? What did I sign up for?
Alright - so I now have Animal Crossing... my weekend is screwed isn't it...

The problem with "influencer marketing" is exactly what you mentioned before - lack of path. I would posit that what we have seen with "influencer marketing" in the past has been sullied by people building their own brand (not wrong per se) at the expense of the company message
Right? You're either making the thing, or selling the thing. Your Dev audience knows you work for the fucking company when you're talking about whatever it is they do. We're not talking about the hard sell - but advocating for a FUCKING PRODUCT IS FUCKING PART OF WHAT SALES IS.
Fuck. I'm going to have to finish post 6 and 7 of my rant on DevRel needing to grow the fuck up and evolve aren't I?
Heh I provided some of the same in another reply
I get so fucking incensed when I see Dev Advocates and Community people bemoaning being held to metrics, or repeating the same old nonsense of "DevRel isn't {Sales|Marketing}". Grow the fuck up. You're both of them - and you're neither of them.
Some of the biggest harm to DevRel and its perception has been the "influencer" marketing push that many companies tried to do with DevRel, hiring every up-and-coming person and throwing money at whatever they wanted to do.
This landscape has shifted, and I will just come right out and say it, because too many teams lack seasoned leadership around how to interact with other departments. They don't want to learn from Marketing, Sales, Product, Engineering - they want to travel.
Oh for sure - and that's what Twilio did. Twilio DevRel in 2010 is _vastly_ different from what they do today. Same with _every_ single company.
Yep. It's imperative that DevRel position itself as supporting initiatives across the company, and aligns its activities to how they help achieve them. This involves having conversations with _every_ department to identify what their goals are. But often DevRel doesn't want to.
Too many companies want to cookie-cutter what they've seen other companies do (like Twilio in the early days), but don't understand that you have to tailor to: - what your company does - who the customers are - what stage you're in - state of your product - etc.

LOLWUT? You've just made a public statement that you don't want women saying they won't share the stage with an abuser and asking to be told if someone is. What if she had said she won't share a stage with a fascist, and if someone on the stage is one to let her know? Is that ok?
You choose who you want to be associated with. We make personal judgements and choices all of the time and determine whether or not we will do something based on who's there. Why is it any different when a woman says they choose not to be around someone? It's hypocritical.
The person being abused, that's who. We have a long history as a society of _NEVER_ believing women when they say they have been abused &amp; look where that's gotten us! If a man doesn't want to be accused as an abuser, maybe, I don't know, don't act like or be an abuser. Simple.
And, why does that matter what you think here? She's neither judge, jury, or executioner. She's merely standing up for her ability to cognitively make decisions herself, and choosing not to associate herself with an abuser. Does that threaten or affect you in some way?
I'm done with "Well that's just hearsay". I believe the abused. I will not share a stage with an abuser. I #BelieveWomen

Oh I understand Twitter all right. And I understand that it's one thing to drive engagement with asking people's opinions on something, and it's an entirely different thing to drive engagement by making inflammatory statements.

Having fun at other people's expense is not fun at all. Do better.
I have no problem having fun. But when you make definitive statements, be prepared for people calling you on the bullshit, especially when you attack people who have literally been programming with a particular language and say they haven't been programming.
Then instead of making bullshit claims/statements to drive engagement, be more inviting and ask people's opinion about Bash as a programming language. This "it's just words and definitions" bullshit is beneath you Kyle.
Saying a programming language isn't a programming language is totally the Turing definition of gatekeeping. And saying something ridiculous to drive engagement ("it's just words and definitions" - come on dude) is bullshit.
Yeah, Bash is a programming language and gatekeeping statements like these are detrimental to the broader industry. We were writing Bash scripts (literally programming) before you were likely born (1989 is when Bash came out)

Going on 7 years now, wouldn't have it any other way.
Totally agree. It's so rare to find a good one that it makes it often not worthwhile. Until that time you find one...
_Real_ Kona coffee is good, as is _real_ Antigua. Jamaican Blue Mountain is _ok_ but only the _real_ stuff. I emphasize _real_ because too often what is "called' those is not and only labeled to sell. Coffee's sold on location are rarely the best because they make more exporting.
That varietal was a Pacamara &amp; it was unbelievable, &amp; we even used it on occasion as a single origin espresso &amp; it was amazing (rare). I say rare, as it's not often you find a single origin that is capable of having all of the marks of a good espresso (acidic, sweet, full body).

Trump has no earthly idea what the role of the President is, what the State's powers are, &amp; how the Federal government gets its power from the people. Imagine if Obama had said this! McConnell, Graham, and FoxNews would have blown their collective tops. He thinks he's a dictator.

Well that's the end of Hackers with "Crash and Burn" in the rooftop swimming pool. Solid movie - crazy it's been so long since I've seen this. Won't wait nearly so long next time.
"They're going for the kernel!" "Colonel who?"
"Too many garbage files, gonna need more time!"
Throwing around the term "They are Elites!"...
Hackers is really bringing back fond memories of my time as a Unix Sysadmin / Network Admin at an ISP in 1995 when I had a Sparc 20, T1, and Cisco 7000 all to myself.
Spray-painted keyboard is akin to the gaming keyboards of today. Wish I had done that back then!
P6 chip ("triple the speed of the Pentium") LOL, PCI bus.... "RISC architecture is going to change everything" Had so many of these conversations in 1995.
Already past it - and did have a chuckle...
Yeah it was certainly ahead of its time. Enjoying my first watch of this since before the 2000s
Love this view of the internet and tech in ‚Äú1995‚Äù‚Ä¶ fully-functional VR?
Deal.
Yep - I completely missed that when I started it up‚Ä¶
Correction - CSO in 1995... Even more surprising.
Hmm - that‚Äôs a fair point‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm watching this again and assuming 1995 was 11yo Dade. But you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ He was 19 in 1995. Man it‚Äôs been _way too long_ since I‚Äôve seen this flick.
A CSO in 2002? Very cutting edge!
Hack the Planet TV show on pirated airwaves... Nice touch!
The Plague rides into the data center on a skateboard... he's the serious one. And their view of cyberspace is crazy insane...
A lot of useless chatter, as they all size themselves up for bigger and better things.
Dade keeps flashing to TV scenes to reflect his emotions during a scene.
Ahh, the old "there's a pool on the roof!" with the self-locking door trick...
It's commercial time (watching from DVR) and oddly apropos we have a Norton360 with LifeLock commercial. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Now he's engaged in a videotape tug-o-war with another hacker, Acid Burn.
Dade replaces the "America First" TV show (oddly familiar given today's nationalism) with "The Outer Limits"... and pops a cold one? He's 18. This is 2002. Doesn't he know he's not supposed to drink alcohol until he's 21?
Now his brain is flashing back through weird scenes as he prepares to wreck havoc... Sounds familiar.
Nice example of a phishing scheme pulled off by Zero Cool to get the security guard to give him the modem number
What is this computer system he's supposed to be using in "2002"?
Always forget Angelina Jolie and Matthew Lillard (Stu in Scream) are in this movie...
Zero Cool has quite the smug look on his face hearing about his accomplishments, until he's told he can't use a computer for 7 years.... By then he'll be greated with the Pentium 4... What an improvement over the Pentium Pro in 1995.
Little Dade, err I mean "Zero Cool", singlehandedly crashed 1,507 systems (including Wall Street trading systems), singlehandedly causing a SEVEN-POINT DROP IN THE NYSE!!!! That kid's got nothing on Trump! He knocked 3,000 points off the DJIA in one afternoon without a computer.
Prosecuting Attorney says that "(Zero Cool) possesses a superior intelligence which he uses to a destructive and anti-social end..." as if there were any other options for 11yo Dade Murphy in 1995.
Mom's pretty nonchalant about the dog freaking out in the front yard... My mom certainly would have checked to see what all the racket was.
These agents storming this suburban stronghold sure take their time getting out of the back of the SWAT van... don't want to sprain an ankle now, do we?
So I'm watching "Hackers" for the first time in I don't _know_ how long... I'll try to keep up with the tweets through this action-packed blockbuster from 1995....

Self-service for devs - devs shouldn't have to put up with shitty interfaces to work with their internal tooling anymore. Add simple process improvements and apply automation - at #FOSDEM
Platform as product - have to apply the methods of Product Mgmt to your platforms, with Service Managers using ITIL for instance can be utilised. Don't shove things at your devs and say, "Good luck". (Good resources at the bottom of the slide) - at #FOSDEM
Platform Operations ... You have to treat internal apps and users the same as you do your external apps and users. - at #FOSDEM

You are correct that we have precedent for CoCs in online "venues"... My thinking here is that the platforms used (as mentions in another reply) make it difficult to recognise infractions and support the enforcement of the CoC. I have a strong feeling this will be hard.
Yep, though one of the things suggested during a discussion with and others earlier this week was using Discord, which _does_ have moderation abilities.
In the #devrel discussions about the opportunity/possibility of online events being a substitute for in-person, I have yet to hear any conversation about the challenges presented with CoC. Online is where violations happen demonstrably more than in-person (right?)... Discuss....

Turns out the .js file is really just some formatted JSON, and was able to handle it (30MB file required me to become a PRO user for a short time, costing me $10 in this process). I cleaned up my tweets from 18,350 to 5,150 for Tensorflow to have fun with.

So I'll ask this question... How do we define "community member burnout"? A large part of me wonders if we aren't assuming a lot?
TMW you find the hat that gave you at #Scale17x and you thought was lost
One of the challenges is how you recognise burnout in your community members. There's a natural lifecycle ( attached) with some lowering contributions as their life changes, while others lose interest, and others get exasperated. Figuring out which is hard.

"Unlimited time off is a scam and an accounting loophole for companies." - at #DevRelCon If your company has this, dictate requirements within your team that they take minimum time off.
Things which can be done: - limit scope of distributed work &amp; travel (regionalize things) - meet during working hours which are convenient for the regionalized - lead by example (take time off, don't email/chat after work hours, etc) via at #DevRelCon
Travel brings about its own advantages and disadvantages, and giving yourself time to work through them is important. Shared experiences with coworkers while traveling can make/break the desire to work at the company. Burnout can be increased as well. via at #DevRelCon
Some downsides of distributed work can be a sense of interpersonal disconnection. Make sure that if you're a manager of distributed personnel, you immerse yourself on occasion with the challenges they experience. via at #DevRelCon
When workers have the opportunity to work "remote" they tend to be happier, get more done, and work more. And the systems you put in place around distributed personnel, even those who are only distributed when traveling, can make/break it. via at #DevRelCon
"Remote" is a much more attractive option for employees, and can bring about more options for processes, and attracting talent. via at #DevRelCon
"Remote" can bring different definitions, and not all are positive around the work we do. We need to be careful about the connotation. "Distributed" is a much better word to shape our mindsets around our teams.

YES! The connotations for "sales" &amp; "marketing" have been pushed as a "us vs them" response, &amp; DevRel (as in many ways was a reactionary play against those connotations) is now growing out of its teen years &amp; experiencing a reality check. #devops principles can/should unite all!
And anyone who chooses to go into marketing, sales, support, devrel, etc. shouldn't be vilified, but instead should be collaborated with to further the company's goals
Absolutely. The reality is that every department in the company contributes to the bottom line in some way, and to take the approach of "marketing and sales is BAAAADDAADDDAD" is damaging to the company as a whole, and the message as well.
And he'd just lie and cheat in order to win.
Yes, I am. And I should have qualified that. I was working on character limits and didn't convey "traditionally viewed as" which was intended, instead of "this is _exactly_ what marketing is"
I know this is oversimplified, btw, but I felt like a simple answer was best for now. Happy to delve much deeper into this in person, on Zoom, etc.
Now u could totally say this is "tech marketing", &amp; you wouldn't be all that wrong. But the OKRs would be different. Due to most developers, and those in the DevRel field, hate to be considered, associated with, or targeted by marketing, the term is "taboo". [3/3]
DevRel, on the other hand, by nature is about relationships with developers - meaning that marketing approaches are not used, and are avoided at all costs. This leads to more personal ways of interacting, through videos, communities, workshops/meetups, etc. [2/3]
So I will take a stab here..Marketing, in general, is about blasting a message to as many warm bodies as possible irrespective of the individual, a sort of "shots on goal" approach, using things like email, ads, geofenced intrusions, etc. Many of the things that devs hate. [1/3]
There are some companies who have, and still do, that. Some of them, like AmEx, have folded those orgs though. Others do "internal DevRel" where they serve as liaisons between the internal users of the company's tools (customers) and Product or Engineering.
Sounds about right

Yessss
Nice smoke going on for the moment, and then will boost to 250F soon for the 3-4 hr cook
I'm starting the at low, roughly 180F, to get a good steady smoke for 30min, and then will adjust to 250F and let it cook until it hits ~160F (around 3hrs) and then I'll wrap it and cook at 275F the rest of the way until it's around ~195F

Hah, just posted
After resting for a little over an hour, I sauteed some mushrooms in the juice from the roast, smoked some asparagus, and then sliced up the sirloin tip roast. :chefs-kiss:
Lol I'm hoping it turns out ok. It's a sirloin, so not as tender, but I'm hoping as it rests it'll tenderize a bit more
After smoking to 125F over 3.5 hrs, I pulled it (pic 1) and then put it in the broiler for ~5min each side (pic 2, internal temp at 130F), and then back into the smoker until 140F (pic 3) and now it's covered and resting until I cut and serve it in the next hour or so
Nope! I try not to do that
I prefer pie, so Jan 23 is the better day, but I like cake too.

RT Facts!
Took the ~8lb sirloin tip roast out of the fridge and the brine has been nicely absorbed (toothpicks are to keep the wrap in the fridge from touching the meat). I'm now using Brisket Rub and liberally applying it, and going to smoke it in a roasting pan to catch the juices
The smoker is now warming up to 230F. I'm using a "signature blend" of pellets (hickory, cherry, maple) to start (almost out) and then it will be straight hickory pellets for the rest. My guess is roughly 3-4hrs on the smoke and then I'll sear it in the broiler.

I have seen this repeated time and time again - and it's so true. A character trait that seems to be commonly missing from leadership (from the top down) is empathy. A lack of it seriously impacts other areas of your company, and their ability to truly serve the customer.

It usually is going to depend on what the goals are for the company. But I personally would say, if you aren't being an advocate for the developer... Don't call yourself an advocate and put off the wrong impression.
The health insurance companies have fed us a line, that single payer healthcare is evil, and many have let the GOP perpetuate this lie.
Evangelists spread the good news of the product &amp; are usually more (or only) outward facing. Advocates literally are advocates of the developer to the company, &amp; from the company to the developer. The point though is they are also broad terms which take the form of the business.

Yep. Agreed. A complete and utter disconnect in logic and reasoning because of the rush of firing a weapon of war which makes your underwear moist and helps you compensate for something...

Oh really?
Interesting. So if I understand, you're saying that with our current laws we've moved past the 2A? I get that point, and for the most part I think I agree, but that would also lend itself that we need to fix the 2A, which I believe is needed, and should be common sense.
Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe should be the first thing you do. Do not leave without visiting. Reichstag is great and all, but this is what you should see first. Take the tour. Worth it. #NeverForget #NeverAgain
Complete, and utter lack of empathy. First, you bring the baby BACK to the hospital for a photo op with Trump, ignoring that the baby HAS NO PARENTS DUE TO VIOLENCE ON YOUR BEHALF. _THEN_ you flash a thumbs up and smile? Unfit and unwell.
I would not call myself a gun advocate even though I believe in the 2A. I believe that we need a rethinking of the 2A in light of the culture &amp; world we find ourselves in today, which is not the Founding Father's world. And yes, the pervasiveness of guns is part of the problem.
This is why they really don't want to fix illegal immigration. If they did, they would take down the big Help Wanted sign at the border &amp; prosecute the business owners. But they don't because illegal immigration (the way they frame it) allows them to further gaslight their base.

These are the 2 BIPARTISAN bills that the house passed 240-190 which #MoscowMitch has blocked from being voted on in the Senate: HR8 - HR1112 - They aren't wanting to take _ANY_ guns away, instead they are common sense legislation.
I see that becoming a meme which you'll then send me quite often
They make for great backdrops during conference calls
It's French.
I get a laptop case (~$20) and then take it off when full, hang it on my wall, and get a new one. Rinse. Repeat.
They were all American White Males. The GOPs response instead is to ban Muslims and Latin American refugees. :godzillaFacepalm:
Gonna go with a hard "No he won't" on this one. Sad.
#MoscowMitch could contribute to a simple reduction in these events (note - not an end, but a reduction) by simply bringing the BIPARTISAN bill to a vote. And _maybe_ even keep his Senate seat.
This is such a tired, old excuse that doesn't hold water. White Supremacy is Domestic Terrorism and is the problem here, along with the easy access to guns that #MoscowMitch is contributing to by not allowing votes on bipartisan legislation.

So in closing, thank you to and #chesterbennington for what they've meant to me in my life and for the impact they've had on so many around the world with their raw passion and talent. And for #SuicidePrevention call 1-800-273-8255 or [11/11]
So I say all of this, to say that I came across this performance in Germany back in August of last year... Shinoda talks a little about where they stand and then invites the crowd to a sing-a-long... And I broke down while making breakfast. [10/11]
This performance of "One More Light" on Jimmy Kimmel Live was poignant given their dedication of it to Chris Cornell ( but the last performance of the song ( is especially heart-breaking. [9/11]
...two years ago, July 20, 2017. That is when Chester took his life after years of depression and substance abuse. I cried. Not ashamed to say I balled, almost as much as I did when Johnny Cash died. The new album was out and I had heard "One More Light".. Crushed.... [8/11]
There were a few other songs which I really loved ("Bleed it Out", "Hands Held High"), but that album was lower on the list for me overall. Over the coming years I would mix all three of these albums into a regular rotation, but ultimately would take a backseat... until.. [7/11]
In 2007 "Minutes to Midnight" released &amp; with it "What I've Done". Around that time I was beginning to come to grips with decisions in life I had made &amp; consequences. This song would ultimately become an anthem for me, &amp; I was even able to play guitar on it at church once. [6/11]
It was around 2003 that I got to see them for the first time (ultimately 3 times in total), and was blown away by their willingness (especially Chester) to wear their heart on their sleeve in person and not just on an album. It solidified them to me as a favourite. [5/11]
"Numb" was a fist-raising moment for me, especially the words, "all I want to do is be more like me and be less like you!" I was struggling with all that was changing in me (politics, faith, feelings) and trying to figure out what "be more like me" was like. [4/11]
When "Meteora" came out, "Somewhere I Belong" brought me to tears the moment I heard it. The anguish, pain, discomfort with life was all embodied in the song and was so real to me as I was struggling to learn how to be ok with feeling feelings... [3/11]
With songs like "Crawling", "Papercut", "In the End", and "One Step Closer" they spoke to feelings I had at times, and feelings I never had the space to express, through how I grew up &amp; the place I was in life. I would listen to that album repeatedly, with growing emotion. [2/11]
So a bit of rawness today... When #LinkinPark burst onto the scene in 2000 with "Hybrid Theory", it blew my mind. I loved the music, but it was the raw lyrics and passion as a band which spoke to me. Chester's voice, and Mike's measured cadence captured me. [1/11]

Yeah, with as much booth duty that I've done I use hydration packets added to a bottle of water (once in the AM, one at midday, and one before bed) and I've noticed a huge difference. I personally prefer LMNT since they have low calories

(4/4) Sure, you can make the case that you can say whatever you want. You are free to. But that doesn't mean we have to listen &amp; doesn't mean you're exempt from the consequences of your speech, which may see you escorted/banned off of the premises of these services. ¬Ø\(‚óâ‚Äø‚óâ)/¬Ø
(3/4) The restriction here is on Congress, and by extension the Government. It does not restrict private companies/organizations/etc from having rules about how you use their services. If you don't like their rules, you're free to not use them. Period. It's that simple.
(2/4) "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

You don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know - seems simple enough, but there are ways to move towards 2.0 now: - canonical logs - Add trace IDs and span IDs - Feed data into columnar store - Storage with high cardinality - Explorable data / dashboards - at
Observability is really hard - but 2.0 attempts to simplify and make it faster and ultimately cheaper. It can be so much easier - by using data. The more you inform your gut, the better you become as an engineer and a high-performing team. - at
The cost model in 2.0 is about paying for the data store once, and leaning on infinite ‚Äúcustom metrics‚Äù (i.e. cardinality). You will pay more with 2.0, but the value goes up and allows for more predictability. - at
‚ÄúThe best debuggers are the people who are the most curious‚Äù - at
How we debug in Observability 1.0 vs 2.0 is about having data / breadcrumbs that immediately inform you of the problem instead of relying on the experience of someone who‚Äôs been at the company the longest, and has the most scar tissue. - at
Interacting w/ production is different between Observability 1.0 and 2.0. The bar for paging you when something is broken/not working should be quite high - and SLOs (contracts between your teams &amp; users) are essential. Only interupt them w/ pain. - at
It‚Äôs 2024. Use structured data!!! Observability is how you build your stuff &amp; integral to the entire SDLC, not just Ops. Understand where to invest more effort. 1.0: How we operate software 2.0: How we develop software - at
So much of our debugging is influenced by the ‚Äúscar tissue‚Äù that we‚Äôve developed over the years of seeing a particular problem. Swiftly being able to follow your nose is key to 2.0. But you need data + metrics. But they can‚Äôt exist in a bubble. - at
The migration between Observability 1.0 and 2.0 is about identifying and taking the paths available. It‚Äôs also identified by the number of data points and tools in use (vs. 1 source of truth = 2.0) and how you store the data you capture. - at
Charity talks about the history of observability, and how much Facebook‚Äôs internal tool, ‚ÄúScuba‚Äù, contributed to accelerated delivery times. Understanding your system state is revolutionary &amp; foundational to deliverying complexity. Bring on 2.0! - at
Getting to production is all about fixing the bugs quickly - because they start costing you from the moment that bug is born. Your ability to move swiftly, and get to production is reliant on your observability. - at
You can‚Äôt get a high performing team just by hiring an ex-FAANG engineer. It‚Äôs about the systems and processes you have in place. Modern practices all have fast feedback as an essential piece. ‚ÄúSpeed is safety‚Äù LOVE THAT LINE! - at
Technology is eating the world, and every company is a tech company, and so what really moves your teams forward is being a high-performing team. Solving problems can be amazing - or horrific, with so much of that having to do with the team. - at
Yeah, and that's only the tip of the iceberg with that dude I'm sure

A cover up we haven't seen since Iran Contra... Wait... Barr was instrumental there too when he was also Attorney General for George H.W. Bush (1991-93) "How Barr‚Äôs Excerpts Compare to the Mueller Report‚Äôs Findings"
Obstruction is an entirely different matter &amp; the fact the narrative is being spun that since his aides didn't fulfill his requests he's not guilty is ludicrous at best, &amp; not what the #MuellerReport says. It was left for Congress to provide their Constitutional oversight. [5/5]
This is where much of the currently ~20 cases are currently in process against Trump, his campaign, and his compatriots. This is not over. Also, the #MuellerReport made it clear that the evidence was detailed, followed, and investigated for when Trump is out of office. [4/5]
Now any normal, law-abiding person or campaign would have notified the authorities when approached _once_, not the n+1 times of the Trump campaign, by a foreign power who wanted to help them. Obviously a deficiency around the rule of law w/ Trump circle around this point. [3/5]
"Conspiracy" is the crime, and it's what the entire Part 1 of the #MuellerReport is about. It was found that there wasn't any conspiracy, but instead what was found was a campaign that welcomed and asked for assistance from a foreign government in getting elected. [2/5]
Let's be clear on the #MuellerReport - there was never going to be any charges brought or conclusion on "collusion" because it alone isn't a crime. Conspiracy is. The media allowed, and even assisted, Trump in changing the narrative to something that would never be reached. [1/5]

Avocados are good for your heart, and by extension of the analogy #DevRel helps to bring about a happy #community / healthy product... #SCaLE17x
4) Avocados take a long time to ripen. It's 5 years for an avocado tree to be ready to grow, and #DevRel is not a quick fix. Having the ramp-up time to build out the community and to build the connections necessary to do what they're best at - DevRel Qualified Leads #SCaLE17x
3) Avocados go well with many different cuisines. Focus on what only #DevRel can do - making connections with developers. and becoming the hub of the wheel. #SCaLE17x
But "Why do we need DevRel?" Answer comes back to the mantra... "To community I represent the company; to the company, I represent the community." Having both of their interests in mind is ultimately unique to other groups in your org. #SCaLE17x
2) Avocados take on the flavour of things around them. #DevRel teams take on the "flavour" of the product and company and it's important to start small and focused and understand the "Why" and "What" about your #community and putting them where they can best succeed. #SCaLE17x
#DevRel value comes from enabling developers to champion your product/services. Inspiring and equipping them means understanding what they're trying to do, and helping them to be successful. #SCaLE17x
1) Avocados are the good kind of fat. Talking to developers &amp; getting product feedback, learning about what they're interested in, the tools &amp; documentation they use or need, are all important pieces that #devrel helps feed. These would track to "DevRel Qualified Leads" #SCaLE17x
Defining terms is essential around #DevRel... #community and #Developerrelations DevRel Professionals have the best interests of the community in mind which tracks back to the business. #SCaLE17x
Developer Relations (#devrel for short) has become known as the good kind of fat in organisations #SCaLE17x

As I am getting ready for the last talk at #SCaLE17x, I wanted to take a moment to thank 's head for helping to frame the slides on my live-session-tweets. It's been a pleasure working with you, and here's to the next conference!
4) Stay healthy - avoid the habits which are detrimental to your bodies. #SCaLE17x
2) Being on-call needs to become your #1 priority (allocate mental bandwidth) and making sure your manager knows and supports you. 3) Have an awareness that on-call is a stressful activity - important to treat yourself during this time. #SCaLE17x
Self-care for those who are on-call and incident commanders is essential to help prevent burnout in a normally high-stress environment. 1) Create a ritual for going on- and off-call (context switch). #SCaLE17x
You can't predict the future with certainty - our systems are complex. We have to understand that ML doesn't give us fact, instead they give us multiple outcomes. #SCaLE17x
Practicing via incident injection helps your organisation realise that it's no big deal when there is an outage and allows you to process failure and trauma and stress much easier. Storytelling is essential as part of postmortems and helps the organisation deal. #SCaLE17x
This is fine
Resiliency doesn't mean nothing ever happens - it means you're able to respond in a practical, normalised way and everything doesn't have to go pear-shaped. #SCaLE17x
Inside of tech we tend to jump on "root cause" by assuming it's one thing which caused the incident - which is rarely the case. We can miss other factors which contributed because we get lost in what's happening. #SCaLE17x
Being hyperaware of threats (fight or flight) is the organisation stuck on "On". These orgs have a hard time moving on from outages/incidents as they're constantly looking over their shoulder. They then tend to freeze and shy away from change. #SCaLE17x
Trauma is not simple - it's nuanced. It occurs when one's solution does not work, resulting from real or perceived threats, and is subjective and relative. #SCaLE17x
Humans are not zebras - we don't shake off trauma when it happens. Our brains are kinda dumb, and can't tell the difference between real or perceived trauma. We are often readily overwhelmed #SCaLE17x

Managing burnout can be done with any one or more of these things... Some are things you do, others are things that people do for you, making it important that you find people to walk alongside of you. Most people don't have the emotional confidence when in burnout. #SCaLE17x
The six stages of burnout - they generally build on each other step by step. Managing stress and anxiety is extremely important and helps you know where you're at in the stages. #SCaLE17x
Stress is glorified, especially in SV, and it's stupid. Stress is normal, but designing your life in a way as to minimise it is essential. Burnout comes when stress finally takes over and is episodic. #SCaLE17x

Resolving Conflict takes practice. Look at it as an opportunity to practice this skill. #SCaLE17x
Cultural Differences - it's easy to forget there are differences which separate us and can cause conflict. #SCaLE17x

Third cause of conflict is Uncertainty - more certainty you can provide in your #community, the better off you will be #SCaLE17x

Thanks Chris! Look forward to hopefully meeting at KubeCon in a few weeks!
[14 of ?üßµ] There's more to come around metrics and some real-world examples of how all of this series fits together into a #DevRel org. I hope you enjoy, and I welcome the discussion which comes from our mutual desire to move DevRel forward.
[13 of ?üßµ] #DevRel as a profession needs to grow the fuck up and recognize that it's not a bad thing to participate in the marketing/sales process. You can do so and still keep the trust with devs.
[12 of ?üßµ] In business you're either making, or selling, the thing. #DevRel must always balance the needs of the customer and the needs of the biz. If customers (devs) don't end up using your product you'll be out of a job. That's basic economics....
[11 of ?üßµ] #DevRel is in a unique spot to provide value to Sales (gasp!) because it can help to grow usage of the Product within a company by making devs aware of the services which drive more adoption inside that company, leading to increased Revenue!
[10 of ?üßµ] Once you've identified the impact your team can bring, it's imperative you start positioning your #DevRel team as a resource with enormous potential throughout the company, because of its close proximity to your target audience: Developers
[9 of ?üßµ] The mythical DevRel-Qualified-Lead (DRQL) is a perfect example of proving your #DevRel team's value through the Customer Journey, identifying ways you impact orgs like Marketing, Engineering, Recruiting, Support, and YES, even Sales!
[8 of ?üßµ] #DevRel and customer journey steps: 1. Find out what it looks like, 2. Identify activities your team is currently performing, 3. Match them up with their spot in the Customer journey, 4. Automate wherever possible, 5. Build reporting, and 6. Rinse. Repeat regularly.
[7 of ?üßµ] And that's where those questions come in handy - you already know how other orgs define success, which helps you get a leg up on identifying your team's customer journey touch points. But before you get there, you need to identify that journey
[6 of ?üßµ] #DevRel is not a revenue-generating org - it‚Äôs a cost center. But that doesn't mean it doesn't provide value! Quite the opposite! One of the best ways to show and prove that value is by aligning your team's activities w. the Customer Journey...
14) Automate as much as possible, but realise when a personal response is required #SCaLE17x
13) Prepare as much stuff in advance as possible / be prepared and communicate effectively #SCaLE17x
12) Create community reward programs at all levels #SCaLE17x
11) Celebrate new initiatives and launches, and meeting milestones #SCaLE17x
10) Show appreciation and gratitude - different than sending thank you's and swag. "In person experiences are the ultimate reward" #SCaLE17x
9) Gamification doesn't have to be competitive #SCaLE17x
8) Empower and trust your top participants / find your superstars and let them shine #SCaLE17x
7) Create an environment for trust, collaboration and accountability #SCaLE17x
6) Incorporate feedback loops into everyday practices, borrowing from agile and lean principles #SCaLE17x
5) Remember that every interaction is a gift, and surprise is the opposite of engagement #SCaLE17x
4) Listen more, talk less #SCaLE17x
3) Send "Thank-you's" which take on different forms #SCaLE17x

Exactly. Follow the other thread about these gimmicks.
Of course that was mentioned as a use case to a room full of people who would "Ooh" and "Ahh" the very thing that they do so as to amplify the voice for said gimmick.
Again... Anything that's given any fanfare at these events is a gimmick - I've lost track of them at this point. You're illustrating the very definition. Doesn't mean it won't sell... Heck the Evo 3D sold units... But its main "feature" was a gimmick and didn't last.
That's a gimmick by definition - "a trick or device intended to attract attention, publicity, or business."
It makes it a gimmick if it is "a trick or device intended to attract attention, publicity, or business."
Strongly disagree. $2k for the Galaxy Flex is ridiculous and it won't sell any reasonable amount of units. Overpriced is still overpriced regardless of if it fulfills the purpose. I can build a bidet for Brandon that cleans _and_ dries his bum for $2500 and it won't sell.
Here's the thing - I've seen everything come and go the last 20 years in the mobile industry. The gimmick trash heap just keeps getting bigger.
Ahh so its an add-on gimmick. That'll go over as well as the Moto Mods did.
Ok. Does any of what you mentioned justify the price tag?

Jose since the collapse at Chelsea has second-guessed himself at every turn. Never made use of the attacking players he had, always content to play for the draw and not the win. He also blamed everything on his players and never accepted responsibility for anything.
Game time under Mourinho is not equal to being given freedom to create and press forward. I don't know what you've been watching, but I've watched Rashford and Lingard since they came up and have seen their progression and impact.
How you figure? Scored a number of goals in the World Cup, is a consistent pressure on the ball.. Was valuable in the World Cup run last summer.

Dewey‚Äôs impact with his system has been massive, with prevalence across 135 countries and 200k+ libraries worldwide. It essentially classifies all of the world‚Äôs knowledge into TEN categories, divided into TEN sub-categories, and going on -via Lisa Kamm at #Monktoberfest
Melvil Dewey had a ‚Äúcomplex legacy‚Äù, with number 10 obsession, social club founder only admitting white Christians, and was fired from his OWN ORG (ALA) in NINETEEN-OH-FIVE for sexual harassment, and his system is STILL used -via Lisa Kamm at #Monktoberfest
Classification systems group/organize data to be compared with other data. These classifications often only make sense in the context of that system, and nothing that contributes to that system. -via Lisa Kamm at #Monktoberfest
Next talk at #Monktoberfest 2023 is Lisa Kamm talking about ‚ÄúClassification and its discontents, and the strong bias of the Dewey Decimal system‚Äù

Becoming a good leader means you use generative culture, leading by being worth following. -via at #Monktoberfest
Naoto Kan (PM) used pathological, power-oriented leadership (low coop, messengers ‚Äúshot‚Äù, failure‚û°Ô∏èscapegoat) Masao Yoshida (leader) used generative, performance-oriented leadership (high coop, train messengers, failure‚û°Ô∏èinquiry, novelty) -via at #Monktoberfest
Without the decisions made by the leader at the site, Fukushima would have been worse by far than Chernobyl -via at #Monktoberfest
The leader of the site had had enough of the PM stepping in, and proceeded to turn his back on the PM and dropped his pants - and then proceeded to do what was necessary to alleviate the danger -via at #Monktoberfest
Regardless of the PM‚Äôs orders, the leader of the site knew they needed to flood with seawater as 3 of the 4 had a hydrogen explosion. The PM was furious and demanded that the sites not be abandoned, and if they did they would all be punished -via at #Monktoberfest
The rapid corrosion of the fuel rods due to the heat ended up causing a hydrogen explosion, and the need to dump seawater in was immediate. But the PM was adamant that shouldn‚Äôt happen -via at #Monktoberfest
The crews heading to the reactor basement were hit with massive radiation as the core was melting down. Many teams were starting to make other plans, which the atmospheric pressure was growing to over 8atm‚Ä¶ -via at #Monktoberfest
The venting of the reactor was taking too long, and so the PM stepped in to find out what was going on, and found out that people were stepping up to probably sacrifice their lives to perform the manual process -via at #Monktoberfest
With unlucky timing of the electricity loss while they were cycling the isolation condenser to control the proper shutdown of the reactor, the reactor started heating up &amp; hitting all sorts of challenges popping up &amp; they needed to vent the reactor -via at #Monktoberfest
The Fukushima quake lasted 6 whole minutes, and the immediate response from the systems worked exactly as intended, and they were well on their way to a successful shutdown. Until the massive tsunami hit, and the systems started shutting down. -via at #Monktoberfest
The first #Monktoberfest talk this year is talking about ‚ÄúThe Magnitude 9.1 Meltdown at Fukushima‚Äù. Japan‚Äôs one of the most actively seismic places on earth &amp; no stranger to tsunamis, but w/ the post-war economic boom they built many nuclear power plants near the water

Ok - makes sense. I was viewing this in terms of timescale like a video and how fast you would be watching something which could be multiple ‚Äúx‚Äù of viewing speed and would make sense to use ‚Äúx‚Äù notation.
You're going 100% faster than you were, which would translate to 200% of the original, i.e. 2x... the "x" notation makes more sense since when you're talking about something being faster, since in terms of some things there actually wouldn't be a maximum and 100% wouldn't work

No your comment was "If the common interest is shallow or fleeting, community won‚Äôt stick. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt build community around a product/brand people aren‚Äôt deeply invested in." Community is still there and valuable to those even if it doesn't fit your construct.
For a highly technical community, where the topic is one that few are able to answer and members of the community are there to get answers, those answering tend to be primarily staff of the company with few members in the community (non-staff) answering.

They aren't a major hardware OEM however their phones do set the bar for the Android Community, so makes sense to include them. HTC hasn't been in those ranks for awhile, which is sad IMHO because for the most part I think HTC has had solid phones, just lacked the community.

Some good thoughts on #devrel... "To give real service you must add something which cannot be bought or measured with money, and that is sincerity and integrity." -Douglas Adams
Instead devs want to know you have good docs, good APIs, good support, etc and then want to be left alone until they can engage on their terms. Which comes back to my mantra right now, "Developers don't care that you know until they know that you care." (2/2)
So my take is developers by far have been over-marketed to such that traditional marketing techniques don't work for them, but work for those who will "swipe the card" which is why that marketing is still valuable. (1/2)

Delivering software quickly, reliably, and safely are at the heart of a good SRE implementation. The DORA report ( laid down the standard metrics around software delivery performance. Both IDPs and Prod platforms inform these. - at
IDPs and Prod platforms have a symbiotic relationship, with IDPs providing a smooth pathway for devs to build and deploy their code to the Prod environment, and the insights from the Prod platform helps devs iterate and respond. - at
Defining the term ‚ÄúPlatform Engineering‚Äù, starts with pictures of the industry definition from Gemini, and then TechStrong‚Äôs definition (highlighted are key concepts of a solid SRE practice) - at

Implementing this ‚ÄúPaved Roads and Guardrails‚Äù or self-service platform approach requires some good paths internally. Start from the bottom up and small in the culture of your teams, and then simplifying the UX/DevEx, and then align to get buy-in. - Joao &amp; Luis at
Having a secure self service template sets the default requirements &amp; guardrails for the deployment without a dev needing to remember all of the details, or forget required security details (or RegEx) (ex. use ‚ÄúPaths‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúPathRegex‚Äù) - Joao &amp; Luis at
Self-Service Platforms help address challenges we see with repetitive requests (developer toil) which should be automated. Empowerment vs Blocking: Self-Service Platform &gt;&gt; Predefined Code Templates &gt;&gt; Infra-provision/deploy &gt;&gt; Security Controls - Joao &amp; Luis at
Utilizing ‚ÄúPaved Roads and Guardrails‚Äù is a good way to address a lot of these problems we face. Paved Roads: well-established highways, safe, vetted Guardrails: compliments to paved roads to validate you have auto-enforcement of important parts - Joao &amp; Luis at

Help teams understand: Adoption Metrics: - teams onboarded - apps using - traffic served - revenue generated by the platform Shared Success Metrics: - new engineers shipping to prod on their 1st week - reduced cloud costs by x% across services - at
Some key pillars for sustainable, anti-fragile platforms: 1. Trusted Platform (services, teams) 2. Shared success stories (use of platform) 3. Internal confidence (metrics: adoption, CSAT, reliability) 4. Ext confidence (P&amp;L metrics, Flow, TTM) - at

Measuring project stability requires utilizing metrics &amp; reports available via like those around: * Responsiveness * Types of contributors * Bus/Lottery factor (if 1 contrib leaves, how screwed are you? Move someone into leadership?) - at #OSSummit
Figuring out the best places to start and to get people involved, be strategic in finding people to get involved in other areas like docs, marketing, etc. - at #OSSummit
Mentoring is vital for preparing people to move into other roles, and then setting up emeritus roles to help give people space to move into and transition out of the project - at #OSSummit
Documenting your contributor ladders help humans to know how to move, and helps you recruit better involvement with understandings of the responsibilities in your #opensource project. Reduce load for maintainers with good leaders - at #ossummit
Making a concerted effort for DEI brings plenty of advantages for your #opensource project - at #ossummit
Being explicit in your governance documentation makes it much easier for contributions. If not clearly documented, then things are uncertain &amp; humans get nervous. Good documentation also provides frameworks for getting started and lower need for help - at #OSSummit
Governance doesn't have to be a pain - it helps set the expectations so that #opensource projects can focus on people, their roles, and how they collab together - so clearly document with tempates - and then help set ladders in leadership - at #OSSummit
Developing and executing on growth strategies means you first have to ID their motivation for contributing clear comms and reduce friction and good first issues to get their excitement flowing for getting more involved.. but be proactive and specific - at #OSSummit
Maintaining projects is hard, and there's a vicious cycle, but investing time and effort early on (onboarding docs) helps you break out of that cycle - at #OSSummit
The problem is hard, because humans are involved, and it's important to be proactive and encourage people to contribute - and there's no magic or one-size-fits-all at building #community and growing contributors for #opensource projects - at #ossummit
Next up for me is 's talk on "Contributor Growth Strategies for OSS Projects" at #OSSummit
So many great nuggets of advice for setting up #opensource projects to be able to advance no-code contributions - highly recommend checking out the video on release - // at #OSSummit
If you have a smaller #opensource project, think: * small (tags, better issue description, templates) * about hiring * about project velocity and merge policies * make yourself available in real-time - // at #OSSummit
There's a lot of toil for #opensource maintainers, so look for someone happy to do that work so maintainers can focus. Also stability brings more trust and helps watch out for burnout, and diversity brings creativity and efficiency - // at #OSSummit
Use the buddy system and help create strong relationships with mentoring. Assigning seasoned maintainers to new projects can help establish processes. And processes change - so be flexible around roles and allow for breaks/breathers - // at #OSSummit
Make the pathway to contributions easier by writing contribution docs, telling people where to show up, and the specific ways to contribute, and don't forget project management! And replicate enterprise roles where applicable - // at #OSSummit
In a great session w/ &amp; at #OSSummit on "Building On-Ramps for Non-Code Contributors in #opensource". Love the thoughts around prerequisites and onboarding to *open source* and not just your project (esp with those used to enterprise collab)

Treble actually makes all of this much easier. They don't have to worry about the core and just need to add their framework modifications and don't need to take months.
Sure... However that is the purpose of the DP program. I am certain we will get Our, but it's disappointing that they weren't able to release as quickly after Final Pie.

As a manager, it's important to set boundaries for you AND your ICs, protect time for you and your reports, incorporate the #opensource glue work and invisible contributions into promotion conversations - at #OSSummit

AMC (Walking Dead) has it, other channels like FX do as well. They just usually keep it to evenings out of principle. My guess is in your case it was a 10p EST thing... Each network will make up their own rule around it. For further info:
This is real. Over 4600 died in Puerto Rico but the administration won't admit it. It is a travesty that PR was neglected but not unexpected of Trump
Oh and cable networks aren't controlled by the FCC... But they are accountable to advertisers. As a general rule they keep that to later evenings.

Yeah that's probably the ultimate impetus for this series I've written. The value is going to look different though for each company, and not easily identifiable (or trackable) for the first few quarters.
Ahh that's another part of this series to come. It's rarely in the early stages, though it can be shown based on connections and relationships built, but usually comes into play when the company moves into later stages when it's no longer awareness mode, and now it's PLG+
But so much of this comes down to understanding where DevRel fits in the customer journey, which I touch on. And the things you track at Seed stage are different than you track in C and D and even pre- and post-IPO
Absolutely. I credit my former CMO at CircleCI for really challenging a lot of my thoughts around DevRel the last almost 4 years. If you're not measuring, how are you going to know what success looks like? Measure what matters.
Pretty spot on. DevRel has gone through a "boom" of sorts over the last probably 5 years (?), and many in the discipline profited from their company's "we must have this thing" and just kinda went with the flow and never figured out metrics and value and being a resource.

RT üß† Systems Thinking and Invisible Work: Bringing Clarity to DevRel - how to surface invisible work to ensure you're tell‚Ä¶
Sometimes with a product we tend to start with a rough idea of what it takes to build (and finance it)‚Ä¶ but with a platform you have pretty clear costs (people, tools, cloud, etc.) regardless of who is using it. But what about the revenue? - at
Next up at Day 1 is with ‚ÄúFrom Fragile to Antifragile Internal Platforms‚Äù When we talk about and implement Platforms, we want to make sure they‚Äôre valuable for your teams &amp; self-service. So treat them as you would a product (get feedback, UAT, etc.)
The DORA report and State of #DevOps Report have shown a consistent evolution of #PlatformEngineering, with the rise of devs supported, standardizing automation, and security baked in - at
There are definite tradeoffs between #DevOps and #PlatformEngineering, with things like how processes are broken down (full lifecycle vs mostly ops, choosing tools vs using tools, etc.) - at
Breaking down the general roles associated with #DevOps and #PlatformEngineering really shows a tools usage and implementation breakdown‚Ä¶ Or use a baking analogy of how you move from being a hobby baker to small bakery to large production bakery - at
Platform Engineering helps create consistency and guardrails, and not supposed to be an adversarial response to #DevOps, and it didn‚Äôt kill DevOps. It‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúhandshake‚Äù, and a good description could be ‚ÄúDevOps for DevOps‚Äù, or what Reddit says - at
Second talk at is (Dev Advocate at ) talking about ‚ÄúDevOps vs. Platform Engineering: Navigating the Path Ahead‚Äù We are all still learning about, and trying to define, #devops and #platformengineering
We aren‚Äôt anywhere close to being finished with #DevOps. Organizations change and we need to help again. New people don‚Äôt know the reasons why we do what we do. We need to teach people how not to shoot themselves in the foot. - at
So where is #DevOps fifteen years later? We still tend to throw things over the wall (both ways) and still don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre doing, why we‚Äôre doing it, and where we want to go. We still make the same mistakes, and old/new is new/old again. - at
And don‚Äôt call it a ‚Äú#DevOps Transformation‚Äù. Ask (and answer) these questions: What are our challenges? Where do we want to go? What do we want to fix? Call it ‚ÄúEngineering 2.0‚Äù or something else‚Ä¶ - at
Your #devopsteam is _not_ a team that handles the tooling, or in charge of delivery, or another silo in between dev and ops‚Ä¶ And there really isn‚Äôt a #DevOps Certification - it‚Äôs just another source of revenue for the vendor. Except for Kris‚Äôs ü§£ - at
We repeat the same thing in #devops: new fancy tools, we don‚Äôt change how we use it, we‚Äôll fail, and Repeat. Same with Agile‚Ä¶ We all ‚Äúkilled DevOps‚Äù with our many tools &amp; conversations on how to implement them, &amp; recruiters with job titles - at
Fifteen years ago we were beginning to understand #cloudcomputing, and how to solve single point of failure, and where to put state. ‚ÄúDocker solves all of that‚Äù - but does it? Complexity gets added, and tools will _not_ fix your broken culture. - at
Then / Now of Culture and Automation (C and A in CLAMS) have evolved, but have they evolved in a positive way? They still need to be fixed, and who is really doing Continuous Delivery? And #monitoringsucks and still not fixed. - at
Where #devopsdays started was with a venn diagram of people dedicated to #opensource, #cloudcomputing, #agile. Have we come very far from the ‚Äúold‚Äù days? Devs still want change, Ops still want stability Also DNS means ‚ÄúDevOps Needs Sushi‚Äù - at
Kicking off Day 1 of is with ‚Äú15 years of #devops, but what did we really learn?‚Äù FIFTEEN YEARS!?!? üò±ü§Ø The crazy idea (with to bring friends together to talk about what would become #devopsdays began in the Antwerp train station

And the sooner DevRel understands where they fit into the customer journey, the sooner they can identify what activities they can (or already) do which contribute to that journey, and then begin to track and report on them, build internal relationships, and be seen as a resource
My statement applies to sales as well. Like I said, you‚Äôre either making the thing, or selling the thing. Marketing is part of Sales - they‚Äôre $-generating orgs. Not everything is a hard sell though. DevRel shouldn‚Äôt be doing sales pitches, but they‚Äôre still a part of the journey
Miller Lite (1 can) with Pineapple Orange juice (~4-6oz) is great. I will not be taking questions. Ever.
DevRel teams, esp their leadership, should be having regular syncs w/ other Business units to understand their challenges &amp; objectives/KPIs/goals/OKRs/etc, &amp; to identify what activities they are (or can) perform to support them, thus raising their value. Probably more to come‚Ä¶.
Any attempt by DevRel to distance itself from areas of the Business will ultimately result in the Business distancing itself from that DevRel team. (cont‚Ä¶)
The point with all of this, is that DevRel has got to wake up and recognize that it _must_ show its value to the Business, and in as many areas as possible, in order to stay ahead of the dreaded ‚Äúwhat do you do?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the ROI?‚Äù questions. (cont‚Ä¶)
An early stage is likely more about Awareness and Acquisition, with its own set of metrics and activities, while a later stage company with Enterprise customers is focused more on Retention, Referral, and Product, with _its_ own set of metrics and activities. (cont‚Ä¶)
The things that DevRel does in a company whose primary customer is Enterprise will look drastically different from what DevRel in an early-stage company does. It has to. (cont‚Ä¶)
Here lies the rub in all of this: DevRel in Company A is going to look potentially completely different from Company C because both those companies are at different stages in {Funding|Customers|Product|etc}. (cont‚Ä¶)
The value DevRel adds for a company has to be aligned with the needs of the business and the bottomline. It HAS to, or else it will be gone. DevRel has to understand what the inputs are the business has/need and then shape its activities accordingly. Probably more on this later
DevRel (as a general discipline) needs to grow the fuck up and recognize that it's not a bad thing to participate in the marketing/sales process. You can do so and still keep the trust with devs. (cont...)
"Devs don't like to be marketed to" is a common (and basically true) statement. But yet, devs respond to marketing all of the time! It's all in how the DevRel person builds that relationship, builds that trust. (cont....)
In business you're either making the thing, or selling the thing. Whichever one you are, your objectives need to line up accordingly. If they don't, you'll be out of a job. (cont...)
But see, in DevRel you must always balance the needs of the customer and the needs of the business. If customers (devs) don't end up using your product you'll be out of a job. That's basic economics. (cont...)

Here's a nice write up on why "letting it get to room temperature" is a myth -
Dry brining in the fridge helps with the brining process as it dries out the outside. And since I'm smoking them, I won't be letting them get to room temperature beforehand. Instead I'll let them sit as long as it takes the smoker to get to 225F, helping them cook "low and slow"
Gonna smoke some 18oz ribeye steaks for dinner tonight. Started out by patting them dry and dry brining with a salt and pepper blend on top and into the fridge for a few hours.

Stefan's misbelief was that DX was more important than UX. With Javascript, you have complexity building on top of core elements. But think about how many libraries are created to just do a simple tooltip? - at #RefactorDX
The DX experience over the last 10 years has brought us from a 2013 Hello World page at 10kb/50kb (compressed/uncompressed) to 100kb/300kb in 2023 and node_modules out of control - at #RefactorDX
Next up at #RefactorDX is , talking about "DX in the frontend developer ecosystem" and identifies a question a lot of us have gotten over the years... "What is all this üí© and what does it all mean?"
This was such a good talk from at #RefactorDX, and you can find her slides at
Inclusive meetings are extremely important, especially with remote meetings, and brainstorming methods can help keep your meetings running smoothly and inclusive at the same time. - at #RefactorDX
Code reviews are already a stressful situation, so it's important to use inclusive language.

As manager or leader leading, it's important to allow the room to present ideas without facing the fear of being rejected / failure. It's also important to give space to other opinions before your own, &amp; avoid passive aggressive comments. - at #RefactorDX
A few ways to protect psychological safety: * Ask questions &amp; get curious * Create open space for making mistakes + Recognize that the curse of knowledge means we assume certain topics / ways of communicating when others have deficiencies - at #RefactorDX
There are a lot of misconceptions about psychological safety, with some clear signs to watch out for in your org - at #RefactorDX
Next talk at #RefactorDX is with her talk on "Cultivating a culture of Psychological Safety in Engineering", with a decent definition from ChatGPT, and then her good summation
Final words from Brian at #RefactorDX "The best solution to a problem is eliminating the conditions that create that problem rather than adding another solution that creates new unique problems."
A lot more in this talk that I couldn't keep up with. Here are the slides, and when the #RefactorDX talks get posted you should definitely check it out! His slides are at:
Getting to a more functional and consistent definition of DX really comes down to Productivity, and: "DX is about the practices and tools that empower developers to produce great end user experiences." - at #RefactorDX
There are some hallmarks of good DX, and Microsoft's Developer Velocity Lab has helped to identify some good measurements with SPACE: Satisfaction &amp; wellbeing Performance Activity Communication &amp; collaboration Efficiency and flow - at #RefactorDX
Next up at #RefactorDX is on "Rethinking Developer Experience", and after doing some querying of ChatGPT, the definition from GitHub really stands out.
Things like CoPilot &amp; ChatGPT create the same challenge StackOverflow created/creates with "copy-paste development", making it "easier" to do things without actually learning the what and the why. Important to validate and verify what is generated. - at #RefactorDX
With new tools and systems, we experience the Jevons paradox ( with the economics of jobs and functions going through resets in efficiency
. used ChatGPT to create the foundation of the abstract of his talk, but stresses the importance of not stopping with what it generates, and instead using it as a base to start. This is also not applicable to every situation or product you're producing.

Yeah when we had our shop, we didn't have a rule (the previous owner did and it drove people away because she'd stalk them or tell them to get out) but I encouraged the staff to chat and build rapport, and ask at some point, "can I get you anything?" Rarely failed to convert.

Here we are in 2023 and people are still saying you should handle your own authentication
Right? Fuck's sake
Oh I know a bit more about this than you might think, having spent time in the Auth industry with best-in-class Auth0. I do in fact know the costs, as well as the costs of _NOT_ using an auth service, and all it takes is one breach for you to lose immeasurable amounts.
That's not what you said at all ("unable to implement auth yourself"). Made up stats don't help either ü§£ It also is in fact harder to secure user data than you make it out to be.
This. #FuckMondays
Too much to ask for today?
I mean, leave it to Disney to reveal all of our plans
Not even to mention all of the fines when your data is, &amp; it will be, breached because you rolled your own. Rolling your own auth has always been a terrible business decision, and responsible for many of the breaches and loss of customer data. Use best in class 3rd party Auth.
Also a bad take. Are you going to comply with all the different regulations around the world, get all the certifications to protect your company and clients, AND have all the staff with PhDs to keep on top of the latest cryptography and 0days? All that alone is millions/yr.

Is never worth it to not deal with assholes in your community. Some good resources here. - at #OSSummit
Code can be quickly changed, culture cannot. Proving that this is important and should be addressed, it's important to be quantitative, and provide expectations (set up front the comms process and rapid reactions) - #OSSummit
You fix this through personal interactions and in-person is the most impactful way (it can be done virtually but is way harder) to build the relations necessary. Also give them confidence that concerns will be addressed. An SLA with your CoC is required here - #OSSummit
The impact of assholes and the problems they cause are very real and important to address immediately. Social behavior and technical ability are not The cost of doing business is not an acceptable reason to allow asshole. - at #OSSummit
The total cost of asshole has _direct_ impact on your community, team, culture, and cascading effects amplify the problem. Engaging with the problem immediately in public is necessary or else it spreads like a fungus. - at #OSSummit
Negative interactions are 5x worse than a positive interaction, and can push someone out immediately or make things less diverse. This is the fault of leadership for the culture of the community. - at #OSSummit
Conflict is good, and where growth happens, but how it's dealt with makes the difference. Look for the patterns and identify what's going on and take action. - at #OSSummit
Rude behavior is contagious and doesn't always have an immediate impact. Examples shown are Gentoo and Ubuntu launch, Glibc move to Git, and Netbsd. Those members can influence for good or bad. - at #OSSummit
How you react or allow the assholeish behavior to continue influences the tone and where your community is going to become. The outliers (assholes and even the best) exist, and does the good outweigh the bad? -via at #OSSummit
How hard is it for people to enter your #community? The world sees what's happening, and makes the judgments on things that you can't control. Some random post will be their first impression. -via at #OSSummit

But just like not everything needs to be K8s, not everything needs to be GitOps. Traditional pipeline systems can and should coexist with GitOps models. - Brendan Burns at #cdcon + #GitOpsCon
Now we're seeing #GitOps moving past K8s, and doing everything you need to have a sustainable application... - Brendan Burns at #cdcon + #GitOpsCon
In the past in containers &amp; clusters, we removed the "snowflakes" (servers that couldn't be remade / every machine is different) and have now made "snowflake clusters", and GitOps is around to help us make platforms consistent and up to date - Brendan Burns at #cdcon + #gitopscon
There is something about the automatic part of #GitOps - with things like Dependabot &amp; GitOps deployment processes keeping things up to date automatically, reducing cognitive load / complexity (note CI/CD also does this well) - Brendan Burns at #cdcon + #gitopscon
GitOps helps turn the management &amp; implementation of different personas - flipping the access control and partition out the permissions structure to reflect the state of the world for that particular cluster - separation of concerns - Brendan Burns at #cdcon + #gitopscon
The onset of different roles &amp; personas impacts what has been built around #gitops, with Platform Engineering becoming more of something being talked about the last few years as a team to build the framework which makes building apps simpler - Brendan Burns at #cdcon + #gitopscon
The move to #gitops with Kubernetes has been around the declarative nature, empowering devs in their daily work and sense of ownership, making things automatic and not having to do the manual work, and then a clean separation of concerns - Brendan Burns at #cdcon + #gitopscon
The last Day 2 Keynote of #cdcon + #gitopscon Brendan Burns talking about where #k8s started and where it is today
Giving developers self-service ways of meeting compliance is extremely important but don't take away control from teams to be able to adjust as they need to. Let developers user their intuition to respond as appropriate. - Nic Chenewith and Brian Oliver at #cdcon + #gitopscon
Being able to have easily reusable code snippets (examples used are Orbs) to automate the processes around signoffs needed to continue and meet the appropriate criteria - Nic Chenewith and Brian Oliver at #cdcon + #gitopscon
An example is the rigorous verification of compliance via the #k8s Admission Controller. The verification is done dynamically as the developer does the work, meeting the needs of the boundaries when they get there. - Nic Chenewith and Brian Oliver at #cdcon + #gitopscon
The typical response seen in orgs is adding more complexity and addressing customer feedback, and really drags things down. Which means a separation of duties between the compliance work and the verification of the work - Nic Chenewith and Brian Oliver at #cdcon + #gitopscon
There are many levels of compliance, internal processes which translate into work in a developers life can bleed together. CI/CD has become table stakes now for how to help reducing friction in teams, increases the knowledge of the domain. - Nic and Brian at #cdcon + #gitopscon
The first look is from 1979 in understanding emergency response of pilots, and when the playbook was created vs what the experts did based on their intuition. Intuition was identified as the main point of mastery. - Nic Chenewith and Brian Oliver at #cdcon + #gitopscon
Next keynote on Day 2 at #cdcon + #gitopscon is "Compliance at the point of change" with Nic Chenewith and Brian Oliver.
The recap of lessons learned from Fatima Taj at #cdcon + #gitopsconz are awesome! Really great session!
Lesson #6: Realize that technical debt might be a necessary evil "Tech debt is the cost of getting it _done_ as opposed to doing it _right_." - via Fatima Taj at #cdcon + #gitopsconz
Lesson #5: Acknowledge that context switching is an unfortunate but very real part of your job You can't get rid of these as you progress in your job, but you can help mitigate them - via Fatima Taj at #cdcon + #gitopsconz
Lesson #4: Acknowledge that project planning is complex &amp; that nothing is set in stone MURPHY'S LAW IS REAL!! - via Fatima Taj at #cdcon + #gitopsconz
Lesson #3 - Practice clear, effective, and efficient communication! - via Fatima Taj at #cdcon + #gitopsconz
Lesson #2 - Understand your project inside &amp; out and its business value Recognize the specific value you bring to the project &amp; that mistakes are normal. Understand the mistake costs &amp; ways to mitigate and avoid the risks associated - via Fatima Taj at #cdcon + #gitopsconz
Lesson #1 - embrace the ambiguity When you start out, what you work on is handed out to you as small subtasks with little to no ambiguity. But as you become more Sr ambiguity becomes common. Understand the what and why to get to the How. - via Fatima Taj at #cdcon + #gitopsconz
Fatima tells a story of when she started a new role on a very intensive project as a Jr engineer with a group of Sr engineers, and then 60% into the project 3 of the Sr engineers left, leaving Fatima as the "accidental Project Lead" - via Fatima Taj at #cdcon + #gitopsconz
Next up on #cdcon + #gitopscon Keynote Day 2 is Fatima Taj, talking about "The Survival Guide to Being a Junior Engineer"

At the very least, a community manager should be taking and summarizing the conversations in the community chat system to be content which can live on. This could be tutorials or quick starts or FAQs.
But a community also misses out when you don't have instantaneous conversation and interaction in the form of a chat option.
A community misses out on a LOT of opportunities to reach a broad audience (and let SEO work for you) when you don't have a forum with information which lives on (in cases of history limits)...
There are systems (like ) which allow for public forums and integrated chat. They both are important, for different reasons and business requirements and outcomes....
Yeah I wasn't referring to accessibility in that sense.
Explains the Dunkin commercials somewhat now
Forums are not always a replacement for chat, but they are extremely valuable to make content visible, accessible, and long lasting, whereas chat is often a gatekeeper

Rationalizing around common solutions to problems, and propagating that knowledge across your teams provides the needed empowerment to remove the toil for devs and reinforce good pipelines -via at #QConLondon
Centralizing infra and IAM role provisioning gives teams the necessary automation to manage their own infra needs (with IAM and OIDC), and integrating across the entire SDLC -via at #QConLondon
Another pattern is to trigger pipelines across projects, using the API to trigger another workflow and use the "circle back" process to integrate pipelines across projects -via at #QConLondon
Depending on your development and business process, utilizing ephemeral environments and spinning up as needed. Leveraging infra-as-code to spin up quick, short lived environments for testing as needed can be a game changer -via at #QConLondon
A good first step to getting out of the complexity and solving some of the complex orchestration problems is to use the API for your pipelines. Follow that up with using your orgs existing messaging tool to interact with your pipelines with ChatOpa -via at #QConLondon
Many of the challenges seen come down to the human element of repeatable patterns, which has brought about Platform Teams to help bridge the gap between developer toil and operations complexity -via at #QConLondon
It's inevitable that we reach the point where complexity creates its own issues and fragility. Equating this complexity and fragility to the Sword of Damocles is very fitting ( -via at #QConLondon

Advocacy isn‚Äôt primarily an engineering function either. Plenty of companies have Advocates doing amazing work who aren‚Äôt in engineering and don‚Äôt have much previous experience in that function. They‚Äôre literally advocating for/to a product, and that takes on different forms.

Now ‚ÄúAdvocacy‚Äù generally comes down to a role which advocates for developers using a product to the company making it, and to the developers using a product from the company making it. It‚Äôs a two-way relationship built on mutual trust in being the ‚Äúvoice of the developer‚Äù.
Not anything I‚Äôve seen at all. Neither are explicitly tied to either department. FWIW, ‚ÄúEvangelism‚Äù is rarely used at all anymore for the most part due to the stigma attached to the word itself. Rare exception would be the few ‚ÄúTech Evangelist‚Äù roles out there.

Here is what I tried... Didn't work out so well... But then I went with a queso instead and it was amazing
And finally the lamb chops were in and out (425F for 20min) and they are delicious and almost gone!
Catching up... The tri-tip and prime rib out and cut up after testing, and so tender and juicy.
I'll have some leftovers...
The brats sliced up and going great with the queso, and the prime rib roast is off a bit early (4hr-ish smoke), but looking great and letting it rest while the tri-tip is cooking
The brats are off and on the cast iron to finish, &amp; the tri-tip is in. It was brined overnight in a coffee/cocoa/red pepper flake mixture, and then sprinkled with BBQ 3001 for the outside. Smelled amazing before the rub, so can't wait! Target temp is 140F, abt 2hrs
Got the queso ready (first time, so who knows) using the failed smoked cheese experiment from a few days ago and it's in the smoker for about an hour.
Rolled the brats in some Pork Perfect rub and they've joined the roast on the smoker for the next hour and then I'll finish them on a cast iron skillet.
RT Sorry I put a demogorgon mask on the baby Jesus in your nativity scene and called it Manger Things.
It's 730a and the prime rib roast is in the smoker to get to 135F before I take it off, hopefully around 1p. The next to go on will be the brats at around 945a. Now to make some really good Guatemalan coffee from delivered via
One of the advantages of a pellet grill, but will be monitoring
That sounds amazing! Love a beef tenderloin. Happy Holidays to you and yours!
And the tri-tip (2.8lb) is in a unique brine (Indian Monsooned Malabar from Broadway Cafe in Westport, MO, with 2 tbsp cocoa and 1 tbsp roasted red pepper from the garden) that is either gonna be glorious or fail. It's in the fridge for the next 12 hrs or so.

Yeah... This WC is pretty damn competitive and the parity is good to see so far.

Yep. Needs match time to get match fit, and only playing ~10min over 2 matches is inexcusable for our most creative player. Could have won against England if Berhalter manages the match (and players) effectively.
I don't think we repeat the performance against Iran in 1998 WC. But... we should have beaten England, and waiting until the 80th+ minute to make a switch after England had in the 60th is mind boggling. Reyna is our most creative and he's not been given match time.
I hope I'm wrong, but the decision by Berhalter to not play his best players in the previous 2 games, and instead go with "we knew that we only needed 5 points" and play for the draw in the last match against England put them in this position to NEED a win to advance. #USMNT
This is great and all, but only making two changes (Carter-Vickers and Sargent) and still no Reyna, presumably because GREGG DECIDED TO LITERALLY NOT GIVE HIM ENOUGH MATCH TIME THE PREVIOUS 2 MATCHES IN ORDER TO BE MATCH FIT. FFS. LET'S GO #USMNT !!

Last 30min sees Berhalter blink &amp; get outcoached by Southgate w/ no subs until late &amp; switching to playing for a tie. What a disgrace, given our control of the match, he moves to GreggBall, waits to make the first move at 77th min, &amp; leaves a potential win on the pitch. #USAvENG

Just saw #BlackAdamMovie w/ my son, &amp; while it was like all DC movies (rudderless &amp; leading characters w/ no setup / reason for being there) it also satisfied my only expectation: a fun, mindless, action-packed movie. That's it. No more, no less. I'd see it again for that alone.
Smaller, black sheep cousin of The Incredible Hulk
Yeah saw the neighbor across the street do that last year üôÑ
And just so we're clear, it's really for me. I just spent a few hours cleaning up the yard, and watched my neighbor's leaves blow over from their trees and yard into mine. They don't clean them up anyways, so they all end up in mine.
Yeah gonna need to pickup the books now
Just started watching on this KubeCon trip, and I'm hooked. It's awesome, and so much more coherent than Westworld was/is.
I like how you think. Call it "Leaf-X".
Agreed. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and can't wait to go back!
Yeah, it's not. At all.
That's overly complex. Just puffs of targeted air to blow them away from my yard and into my neighbors who let all of theirs blow into mine and never clean them up. That's all I'm asking for.

Heh sorry I wasn't trying to drive credentials - I have none. Was trying to contextualize where my thoughts are coming from. Interesting that much of what I learned/studied was as a Republican, and now we're seeing them as the pawn of Putin. And yes, we _definitely_ do the same.
I grew up spending countless hours studying and reading about Russia, their history and the tactics of the KGB, with my Grandpa who was in intelligence. What we're seeing is nothing new, just recontextualized.
They've been using the GOP since the late 90s and shifting idealogies (which take time) since before then. I agree about threat surface area (primarily social media) and our slow response, but we can't deny their ongoing activities leading up to that.
Russia's specific 5th column has been a thing since Dugin's involvement as "Putin's brain" since late 90s, early 2000s. Prior to that part of the KGB playbook has been to invest in gaining kompromat on politicians &amp; people of interest for decades and we see that playing out now.

Acidity is an interesting bodily response to some things, and with coffee can come from a variety of things (bad beans, poor roasting process OR wrong finishing roast, poor brewing, bad water, etc). Fascinates me to no end. Are there coffee varietals that do that less for you?
This weekend has me drinking a "medium roast Colombian" - not something I would normally say (prefer Colombian coffee lighter), but this one via is quite good! The roaster is Drink Coffee Do Stuff - love the name too. Truth in packaging.

Fair. Thinking about the time that the dishwasher sits between cycles that could help the rust process?
Yeah, more about the high heat and drying and associated rust that's the problem with the dishwasher
There's a lot of white privilege tied into proclaiming having "moral backbone" requires someone to quit a job that is providing for their family (in all ways that _THEY_ need and that _THEY_ only know), in a system that is rigged FOR the privileged, and go find another job
Like, I'm pretty against using a dishwasher, but it _really_ shouldn't be an issue assuming you actually pay attention, use a lower heat setting (if you have one) and remove ASAP and dry. The problem is that requires focus - and who has that anymore? lol
Right? Such an amateur üòÇü§£
I agree 100% that you should use dish soap to clean them. The issue with using a dishwasher is the amount of water and drying and HIGH heat that accompanies the process. In theory you _could_ do a quick wash and remove immediately and dry on the stove so it's not left to rust.

Cold brew is meant to be brewed for ~16hrs. This means the coffee beans are subjected to water more than normal, and the oils (which contain the flavor) continue to expand over that time. I've found great success with coarse ground medium-dark roasts w/ chocolatey flavor profiles

Because flywheels have proven their importance in different departments, it‚Äôs important to look at how this fits into our #DevRel teams, programs, etc. Look at how this fits into the ways you‚Äôre working, and let‚Äôs iterate together. - and at #DevRelCon
AAARRRP + Flywheel: awareness at beginning, retention at the end, and then with friction you go with discover to retention. Funnel + Flywheel: start with conversations and awareness, look at where the efficiences are, and adapt. - and at #DevRelCon
The #DevRel Flywheel looks like: - Discover - Activate - Implementation - Advocate With inputs/outputs being the things you would expect. Identify friction between the different stages - and at #DevRelCon
With these #DevRel flywheels, it‚Äôs useful to help focus on sustainable strategies with cyclical methodologies, and improve and iterate on each step &amp; have interventions which make the next turnaround of the wheel being more effective. - and at #DevRelCon
A #DevRel Flywheel has some important components, focusing on different frictions where planning is important: - Stages (similar to funnel stages) - Inputs into each - Outputs - and at #DevRelCon
Existing frameworks are not as holistic as they could/should be, thinking about how to deal with the different stages and iterations. Hence working with ‚Äúflywheels‚Äù, which are already an existing business term. - and at #DevRelCon
The deals primarily with the cyclical way of how people move through community and the changing relationships that devs have with a product and community. You can also have pointed ways to move people through each level. - and at #DevRelCon
The challenge with AAARRRP is missing the developer experience and diving into the cyclical way of engagement with the community. - and at #DevRelCon
AAARRRP ( is another method around identifying where people are in their stage, w/ clear goals for each step. You can take these &amp; drill into different activities for each, and then identify mapping to goals. - and at #DevRelCon
Funnel gives ways to ID the stage someone is at &amp; focus attention on people that will help you get to the goal, but is also linear with a defined beginning and end, focusing on one goal at the expense of others, w/ disposable people. - and at #DevRelCon
The traditional way to look at things is the ‚ÄúFunnel‚Äù (awareness, interest, desire, action) which is useful, giving ways to package up different interventions, based on theory and state of mind that someone engages with the Prod. - and at #DevRelCon
Still in its infancy, #DevRel has exploded over the last 10+ years and different ways to define it. Product Mgmt also came up ~ the same time, but tends to have more methodologies &amp; frameworks, and language for explaining their value. - and at #DevRelCon
Second keynote of #DevRelCon is (from and creator of and (from talking about ‚ÄúFrom funnels to flywheels: tools for thinking about DevRel‚Äù
SO thankfull for Joyce sharing this talk! I look forward to the recording and slides to watch over and over again!
You can‚Äôt just C&amp;P another company‚Äôs strategy - you need to build your own. Test + tweak. Evolve your #DevRel strategies and tactics, stay relevant and continue to add value. - Go where the devs are - Always be testing - Change is the only constant - at #DevRelCon
There are different #DevRel strategies (mix of or all at times) during different stages: - Content creation - Events and conferences - Advocacy - Support (you‚Äôll never stop doing) - Community building - Partnerships and ecosystems - at #DevRelCon
Can‚Äôt emphasize enough the importance of managing the expectations of your metrics with your leadership ‚ÄúMetrics are meaningless if they don‚Äôt impact decisions, and don‚Äôt have a narrative.‚Äù - at #DevRelCon
Biz strategies change over time, back and forth across PLG, MLG, SLG. #DevRel drivers are different leading and lagging indicators, and you have to be careful about Goodhart‚Äôs Law: ‚ÄúWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric.‚Äù - at #DevRelCon
Objectives for #DevRel will change as you move through the different stages, from no OKRs to having OKRs, KPI, stable measurements, and more. Align on the destination with your team, your org, and the company. - at #DevRelCon
There is a #DevRel strategy for each stage of a company‚Äôs lifecycle, and there are different proof points with business goals: - Seed - Startup - Growth - Maturity and each of the stages have different constraints. - at #DevRelCon

I caught the bug last year (had been messing around a bit over the years since my wife grew up in Colorado and Idaho flyfishing) and love it, but I'm a bit removed from being able to do it often enough that I feel it's hard to make it a hobby?
I like that attitude!
Not a bad thought Tim... Look at you go!

Photography actually is something I kinda started to get into, and then never did. Need to revisit

WW2 History was my jam in high school, so i guess that leaves woodworking?

Video games is one I need to revisit
Some good ones! I've thought about scuba diving (land locked a bit here) before, and had some friends that got certified. And I need to play my guitar again more consistently.
I don't play my guitar as often as I should anymore (played for 34 years), and this reminds me I should. Golf... That's a good one, and can check a lot of boxes (alone or with friends, and get exercise too)
I love cooking, especially BBQ &amp; smoking different meats &amp; dishes. It's a hard one for me to identify as a hobby since it kinda is more for someone else's enjoyment. But, that being said, I haven't done it in awhile &amp; need to. And figure out doing it at a conference get together.
I beg to differ
I tried it online, and wasn't a huge fan, but I would totally give it another try in person
Yeah reading is good, but more of a relaxation thing and less a hobby for me. I do need to do more reading though. Thanks for this list!
I used to ride my bike all over town as a kid... Now my knees don't like it when I do it at the gym - but something I should look into as i work to get back in shape. Motorcycle is inspiring, but probably not an option.
I don't think so, but definitely something I should look into. Sounds heavenly.
Definitely need to get out more often and this could also help my fitness levels
Hugging dogs would be the preferred alternative... ü§î‚ò∫Ô∏è
I've never been able to focus on them, getting bored after ~30min (or just frustrated at all the button combos to push in 1/2s while moving from that area to the next). Games like Madden are the exception, but not sure if gaming could become that hobby? I'll have to try again?

Final words: Synchronize on reliability via at #DevOpsDaysRox
Failure happens, embrace it. Start by acknowledging it, and then measure it. Then explore it. Be proactive about exploring it. Utilize chaos engineering (inject flaws into systems to predict how something will react) via at #DevOpsDaysRox
We can turn to intermediaries to help standardize the comms, and diversification across tech, people, etc. Adopt the best tech to solve the problem you have. Borrow ideas from different tech for how they solve the problem you are working on.
Because of the sync between systems and chaos, we can sync on reliability instead
With chaos theory, there's an underlying principle of "chaos synchronization" when the systems interact.
The second area we are connected, is our reliance on "component interconnectedness". That reliance on services, software, and culture dictates how we build software and systems
There are 3 ways we are connected, the first being "service interconnectedness" via at #DevOpsDaysRox
So our complex, often interconnected systems have us always trying to get a handle on the chaos that can happen. via at #DevOpsDaysRox
Chaos is about predictability. Sometimes we think about it all being random. But we can predict over the long-term how things will behave. Enter "chaos theory" via at #DevOpsDaysRox
Our world is chaos...organisms mutate and make new species, some thrive, some go extinct. What does that mean for us if everything could just go extinct for no reason? via at #DevOpsDaysRox
Now we have on "The Synchronization of Chaos"

I feel this today. My flight was set to board at 625a, and because I fly out of MCI, I knew I could cut it close. But I couldn't, since no ride share service had drivers, or they kept canceling. Wife had to take me at 540a which was not ideal. But I made it.

This is Southwest airlines. They're pretty lax from what I have heard, and their President has testified to Congress that masks shouldn't be required on planes anymore (he tested positive the day after making that statement fwiw)

As I'm heading out of ATL soon, I wanted to say thanks to and the entire organizing team for an amazing #DevNexus they put on this year, and for the genuine appreciation they showed the Speakers in the first Speaker Day I've ever attended.

And that's it from at #QConLondon! Make sure to check out our latest State of Software Delivery 2022 report at for even more info on CI/CD and high performing team benchmarks
CI/CD Success is FREEDOM to deliver software on YOUR own terms - focus on quality and team wellbeing - faster adaptation to changes - self-documenting build/test/deploy - easy recovery from failure (so you can deploy on FRIDAY!!!) - at #QConLondon
And when things break, CI/CD gives you superpowers - broken deploys will happen - enable fast recovery &amp; reverts - favour small changes over large releases - this all happens when you PLAN, PREPARE, PRACTICE - at #QConLondon
All of this comes down to people. #DevOps is about people. -CI/CD is the whole org's responsibility (HUGE INSIGHT HERE PEOPLE!) - spread the knowledge to avoid bottlenecks - CI/CD is a handy onboarding tool - at #QConLondon
Looking beyond the cicd tool... - validating changes in prod - integrate with other tools you use - build/deploy info, where you need it? - who needs to know about it? - at #QConLondon
Security and risk management should be top of mind when dealing with CI/CD pipelines, and you need to - keep creds safe - automate security scanning - principle of least privilege - access control - manual approvals - at #QConLondon
Recovering from failure requires - insights into what's happening - log everything - easy access to logs and build artifacts - debug your builds _as_ they fail Via at #QconLondon
Speeding up pipelines doesn't mean that there won't be bottlenecks, which means you need insights into what's happening in your workflows and recovering from failure - at #QconLondon
Running your pipelines faster (important to getting fast feedback) - use rightsized resources - cache everything - run jobs and tests in parallel - run your workflows when they work for you - at #QConlondon
Speed is your time to: - run the pipeline - recover from a failed build - ship a feature - onboard a new team member Having a quality pipeline helps with everything you do. - at #QConlondon
"There are multiple dimensions of CI/CD success, which depends on what your needs are within the team. Dev? Fast feedback. QA? Quality code. - at #QConlondon
"A finely tuned CI/CD pipeline is just like automating your plant growing endeavors. Or sometimes there's risk of thinks going wrong. But it's rarely, if ever, the machines fault. #PEBKAC. We are going to talk about how to get better CI/CD success." - at #QConlondon
"Growing software is often like growing crops, and software dev lifecycle like the growing cycle. You could do things manually, or make life easier and employ tools that help automate (plows, harvesters, irrigation, etc. Software is the same." - at #QConlondon
"Think about the last time you deployed software...and you pushed the big red button, and then what happens? What are your options? I prefer B. It all comes down to automation." - at #QConlondon

RT Chiefs vs Bills if the NFL had proper overtime rules‚Ä¶
Oh for sure. F the Patriots. I think the reason they kept the "TD on first possession wins" variation of the old rules comes down to "excitement" and $ from the networks, because the College rules NFL adapted from can sometimes have a game go on for hrs, disrupting TV programs.
It is a bit humourous that the Chiefs tried to get the rule changed after their overtime loss to the Patriots in the AFCCG... And no one wanted it, and Buffalo's GM called them sore losers
RT NO one remembers, but the Chiefs were one of the teams ADVOCATING for a change in OT rules. No one wanted to listen then.

The 7pb turkey breast is brining in a cran juice, brown sugar, poultry rub, and kosher salt mixture. It'll be in this mixture until around 10a tomorrow, when I'll remove it, wash it, and then stick in a bag with olive oil and the rub to season, then in the smoker around 1p. [3/?]
The pork butt was washed, dried, and then I put zesty Italian dressing as the base and applied a sweet KC style rub and then it will go into the smoker around 11pm. [2/?]
We have some friends coming over tomorrow, and so I'm throwing in a 10lb pork butt tonight for pulled pork BBQ sandwiches (14hr smoke), and then will throw in a turkey breast tomorrow mid-day, and then brats mid-afternoon. Gonna be some good eatin'. [1/?]

Being a friend can be exhausting so they make sure to check in on each other in the ways that work for the other, and it‚Äôs different for each. Collaborating in public also is recognizing it‚Äôs a very curated version of yourself. - and at #Monktoberfest

How did we let #opensource get to the point where people harrassing maintainers was so normal that state actors could do this with something like ‚Äúxz‚Äù and take over? - Chris at #monktoberfest
In 2018 there was an upheaval in the PSF and necessitated a rethink by them on how they dealt with crisises. We now have seen #opensource maintainer burnout used as a weapon - enter ‚Äúxz‚Äù.. The harassers and ‚Äúsaviour‚Äù were state actors. - Chris at #monktoberfest
Fifth talk of Day 1 #Monktoberfest 2024 is Christopher Neugebauer talking about #opensource maintainer burnout, dealing with the stories we talk about and what open source isn‚Äôt. Open Source has a sustainability problem.
There‚Äôs a struggle in #opensource‚Ä¶ a struggle between two wolves. Consumption and Production. The one that wins, is the one you feed. - at #monktoberfest
What we‚Äôre raising, and what companies are giving, is NOT ENOUGH! Maintainers are getting older, and new ones aren‚Äôt showing up. #opensource is about people, but the way foundations ‚Äúprotect‚Äù is through projects, not people. - at #monktoberfest
The idea of #opensource being celebrated as a privilege of successful business is _maddening_!!! It‚Äôs the right paradigm to protect consumers - it‚Äôs not just for ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù businesses. If we want open source to be the future, it‚Äôs for everyone. - at #monktoberfest
So how do we handle maintainer burnout? How do we deal with the way that #opensource happens? There‚Äôs a lot of money - but it‚Äôs not evenly distributed (find a 990 from a few foundations for reference). It‚Äôs about market failure. - at #monktoberfest
The CRA in Europe causes issues due to how open source works‚Ä¶ and while allowances have been made for foundations, it doesn‚Äôt protect single-maintainer-projects. - at #monktoberfest

The ‚Äúsupply chain‚Äù metaphor fails as open source isn‚Äôt a supplier - there is no supplier relationship between the creator of open source &amp; the consumer of open source. You could create the relationship by paying maintainers. Foundations rarely help. - at #monktoberfest
Companies are investing in #opensource to buy insurance - because it‚Äôs CHEAPER. Producing open source is now exponentially more expensive, because of the software supply chain. - at #monktoberfest
‚ÄúOpen Source Software‚Äù is just software‚Ä¶ and accounts for 70-90% of all software in production today. If it‚Äôs not a business model, why does it have a TAM of trillions of $$? And what are companies buying with a foundation? Insurance. - at #monktoberfest
The conversation of ‚Äúopen source isn‚Äôt a business model‚Äù isn‚Äôt helpful in the grand scheme (and isn‚Äôt coming from maintainers)‚Ä¶ Thinking about _better_ business models is what we should discuss. Extreme capitalism paper says - at #monktoberfest
We‚Äôve been talking about #opensource maintainer burnout for many years, because we‚Äôve been framing it incorrectly. The maintainer list is _not_ symmetrical with the download growth of npm, and it was absolutely not sustainable _then_, and isn‚Äôt now. - at #monktoberfest

Pre-req for culture change though, is to be open to AND facilitate feedback. Culture is the norms &amp; values of a community and a workforce is a network of people which can be a network of care. Find ways to lift each other up, tend the culture. - at #Monktoberfest
Steps for culture change 0. ID your own values (go to therapy before starting company) 1. Identify org‚Äôs _enacted_ values 2. Find the gap, change the norms (bottoms-up change requires top-down leadership) 3. Build habit of reflecting on values - at #Monktoberfest
Norms themselves are easier to change than values, and people are more willing to change their behaviour than their beliefs. But it also means those norms are more brittle. - at #Monktoberfest
Design systems so the easy path is the right path. This enables people to make the right, moral choices and the cost of a ‚Äútaboo‚Äù becomes a lot cheaper. Culture change: creating the conditions that make it easier to choose the right thing. - at #Monktoberfest
Knowing a disconnect exists doesn‚Äôt make it easy to deal with. Gaps between the stated values and revealed values reveals itself often in burnout. Burnout is a direct result from ‚Äúmoral injury‚Äù and not from working too hard. - at #Monktoberfest
Organizations often fail at ‚Äúvalues alignment‚Äù, like this statement from a company that installs keyloggers on employee machines‚Ä¶. which goes against the very statement itself. stated values != revealed values - at #Monktoberfest
Hiring for ‚Äúculture fit‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really tell you about the person or how they‚Äôll be in a situation, but ‚Äúvalues alignment‚Äù tell you a lot more about that person and how they apply them to that situation. - at #Monktoberfest
Culture does matter - seeps into everything you do &amp; is an indicator of the norms &amp; values of a community. - Norms are the things you _do_ (doesn‚Äôt make it good) - Values are _why_ you do it These filter down into culture fit, i.e. alignment - at #Monktoberfest
The third talk of #Monktoberfest is talking about values and how companies don‚Äôt really model them. In business school and on hiring panels they‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúculture fit‚Äù, which is a form of bias and gatekeeping in the whole process.
It is amazing. Each season builds on the previous brilliantly.

Fair enough. The need to see if you can attend with context makes sense. But think about it from the perspective of the person inviting you... how considerate is it to them to literally just ignore? Like, you have to go back at some point and look at the context to attend, right?
Only 19? I'm not trying to minimize your busy meetings, but it's 1-2 seconds each to click the RSVP and then Accept or Decline. You're leaving the people who invite you to something in the lurch, whether you go back and decline on the day of or just don't at all.
It's really not that hard, even in Outlook, to click the nice "Accept" or "Decline" option, and remove all guessing.
Just saw your replies... yeah I think that's pretty inconsiderate of my time. If I invite you to something &amp; you don't reply, it's going to have me constantly guessing "did he get it?" or "is he really coming?", &amp; having to wait to "eventually figure it out" is just rude.
Are you saying you just don't "Accept" or "Decline"? Or that you'll accept but don't feel the need to respond with an additional "cool! I can't wait!"?

Our kids, in unison, turned and yelled out, "SANTA'S DEAD!!!" The lady was mortified, our kids were proud of themselves (having informed the nice older lady about Santa's doom), and I giggled about that throughout the store.
One year, around Christmas, we were all shopping at Sam's and we were walking by this sample stand, and the lady there asked our kids, "Are you ready for Santa?"
We never did the "be good or X being will not bring you things". We've always tried to be a bit pragmatic with our kids around those things, and talked a lot about them as the caricature they are. We would start that process when they would ask "who's X". Funny story though..

I agree they should have called witnesses. I'm not convinced it would have made any difference with the Senate GOP. I see the political play there would have run the risk of damaging the next few years.
This also isn't the end of it as Trump has more potential to be held accountable with all of the existing cases (State and Federal) than by the Senate.
Correct. It's not. Impeachment has also been shown to be ineffective &amp; we all knew he wasn't going to be convicted with the spineless GOP. Calling witnesses that already had said they weren't going to show up drags it out and doesn't allow any movement forward on Biden's agenda.

Microsoft followed suit by purchasing FrontPage from Vermeer and releasing it under their name in Oct of 1995. Macromedia followed in 1997 (acquiring "Backstage from iBand) with Dreamweaver. Hands down one of my faves, and was so community-driven #OSSummit #cdcon #devex
The world wide web (that's what "www" means kids!) exploded in the mid-90s as IDEs started becoming more graphical. The first WYSIWYG editor was WebMagic, built by SGI in less than 90 days and released Jan 1995 (great read here - #OSSummit #cdcon #devex
Did you know that Borland Delphi (released in 1995) was one of the earlier cross-platform development tools? And it's still around! develops it, and they _just_ released v12.1 (on the day I gave this talk no less!) #OSSummit #cdcon #devex
Early reviews of IDEs as a concept weren't great - in 1995 Computerwoche (German counterpart of "Computer World") commented that "the use of an IDE was not well-received by developers since it would fence in their creativity." ü§Øü§î #OSSummit #cdcon #devex
HP released Journals from 1949-1998, &amp; in the June 1990 volume they dove into HP SoftBench, and laid out what an "Architecture for a New Generation of Software Tools" looked like via the tool. Well worth a read (pg 36 on) - #OSSummit #cdcon #devex
One of the first IDEs with a plug-in concept was HP SoftBench (who else remembers it?!?) in 1989, was based on UNIX and OSF/Motif window manager, and shipped with its own library (on ebay now for $128.08 - #OSSummit #cdcon #devex
We've seen #DevEx evolve over the years, and a good example is the evolution of the IDE. One of the earliest text editors was Vi (1976), which according to this Illiad comic, we've evidently been mispronouncing all along #OSSummit #cdcon
A #DevEx definition I'm using comes from my good friend &amp; co-founder "the journey of developers as they learn &amp; deploy technology. When successful, it focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder a developer or practitioner from achieving success" #OSSummit #cdcon
Thanks to all who attended my "#DevEx is central to #DevOps Success" #OSSummit #cdcon talk There were a few things I touched on that I am going to include in a thread because 1) I found them interesting, 2) a few of you did as well, and 3) because üòùü§£
